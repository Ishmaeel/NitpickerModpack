# Nitpicker's Modpack

A small collection of ~~OCD~~ QoL addons.

## BoltManager
Fixes the vanilla bolt manager which attempted to limit the number of bolts in player inventory but didn't work due to a bug.

## CharacterNameSaves
Renames auto-save files with character name (as opposed to computer user name) and level name. Creates quick saves with character name too.

## CrashesToRiches
Fixes crash with a specific WishGranter ending. May not work with some addons that introduce new items (if those addons are broken).

## KnifePistol
Double-clicking a pistol from the inventory equips the pistol in knife slot, if slot 2 is already occupied by something else.

## LogFixDefaultControls
The Ultimate Nitpick. Removes two unused settings from `default_controls.ltx` to prevent two warnings from being written into console log.

## NoInventoryCloseDisassembly
Prevents closing the inventory window when disassembling items. Works with and without item animations.

## QuickLoadLast
<kbd>F9</kbd> loads the last save *ever*, not only the last quick save. Also, "Last Save" menu item is at the top of the main menu.

## ReadWatch
Using the wrist watch displays the time in "human-speakable" format. Also none of that AM/PM nonsense.

## SkinningWithSpace
Mutant loot (skinning) window now recognizes 100% more shortcut keys for taking all mutant parts.
